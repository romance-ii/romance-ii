<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Manifesto</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The concept I'm running off of goes a bit like this
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.1</span> Axiom: Violence is filler in most games.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
EG: Zelda is mostly about solving the puzzles, and while a few of them
(shoot  the boss  in  the  eye) are  couched  themselves  in terms  of
violence,  the  majority  of  the   violence  in  the  game  world  is
filler. Killing Bokoblins to maybe get a Rupee can be kinda fun, sure,
but it's not moving the plot forward or really providing much “puzzle”
content, &amp;c &amp;c.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-1-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.2</span> Hypothesis: Non-violence can be fun.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
OTOH, non-violent games tend to be of a very few sorts;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some, like Pac-Man = Katamari Damacy, are basically aiming to
“clear the board” in some way. Alchemy from Pop Cap is another of
this sort.
</li>

<li>Others, like Bejeweled or Tetris, are basically “endless.” You just
repeat the same task over and over, until you lose.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The alternative are games in which the designers have spent a great
deal of time creating a puzzle — which you can probably (a) solve
faster than they can create new ones; (b) look up the solution on
the 'Net in 45 seconds or less.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of  these put the idea  of a non-violent MMO-RPG  in a persistent,
shared world at risk.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We  can't use violence as  filler.  
</li>

<li>We can't let someone “clear the board,” because the next person
will have nothing to do. 

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can, but shouldn't, make it an endless toil: that, eventually,
isn't fun.  
</li>

<li>We can't afford the time effort to have more designers than players
to create specific puzzles.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, the sandbox world has these things going for it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>User generated content: Building and decorating houses and
landscaping your yard, designing and wearing clothes, and so
forth. 
</li>

<li>Crafting and similar rôte tasks; these are like Bejeweled, but you
only do it when you want the results
</li>

<li>AI's who have their own wants/needs/likes. They provide Quest
drivers, basically. The AI's can “intentionally” create situations
which are puzzles to be solved.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
EG:  Some “naughty”  AI character  likes to  build mazes  and has  the
ability  to  create  a  certain   type  of  item  that  is  reasonably
valuable. Solving the maze gives a  reward; but the AI re-arranges the
maze from  time to time,  so you can re-visit  it later, and  it'll be
different. We  started to build  something like this in  Tootsville 3,
but the  front-end choked  on the  number of  “furniture” items  to be
placed on the screen.

<p>
Animal Crossing is  really more about:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>meeting and interacting with the characters, making friends
</li>

<li>creating User Generated Content: decorate your house, design your
clothes, decorate signs, change the Town Song, …
</li>

<li>discovering and collecting artefacts: shells, fruit, fossils, … ;
sometimes these can be traded
</li>

<li>special events [The jazz playing dog on Saturday nights; the Turnip
“stock exchange”; holiday events; special visiting characters]
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In  MMO  context, you  can 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>meet and interact with AI and human controlled characters, make
friends
</li>

<li>create User Generate Content of many of the same kinds
</li>

<li>explore new regions of the world as they are added
</li>

<li>collect different kinds of artefacts and trade them with other
characters
</li>

<li>special events of similar kinds

Chris Brunner  brought us the  world of WWF Tootsville.  AI characters
get controlled by staff members to act  out a story for the players to
watch / join in. This takes it further: we give the AI's programs that
inherently create “fun” situations when they interact.

<h4 id="sec-1-1-5"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.5</span> About in-world minigames</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-5">
<p>
In Tootsville  4, we had  a (working)  soccer park. [I  think actually
that Meixell  had tried to make  something like this in  Tootsville 2,
but it didn't work because the  roomVariable system in SFS didn't work
right.] The  Referee (Stu) was a  robot that kept score  [and reset it
after a while].  The players “kicked” the ball by  walking into it. If
it rolled into a  goal, they got a point; if it  rolled out of bounds,
the Referee would walk over and put it at the bounds. The rules of the
game were otherwise unenforced. The kids still played the game. We got
more complaints about  people “cheating” by buying things  in the Mall
than about the soccer game.
</p>

<p>
Putting open-ended things like this in  the game world might be enough
to  amuse some  people. Perhaps  a “mission”  or “greater  purpose” is
needed  only  to  give you  an  excuse  to  explore  and play  in  the
world. How often have we ignored Navi so we could play some other game
and ignore our Great Quest?

Miyamoto-san:
</p>

<p>
How do I want gamers to play Super Mario Sunshine? In each Mario game,
players sometimes move  around without any specific  purpose, yet they
may find some secret as a  result. While wandering around, players get
accustomed to the  gameplay so that Mario moves just  as they want him
to. Then  gamers feel some  attachment to the  game and don't  want to
sell  it to  used-software  shops. So,  the more  you  play, the  more
attachment  you  feel.  This  is  an important  element  we  want  you
to advertise.
</p>

<p>

you feel like you’re a kid and  you’re out in the back yard playing in
the dirt.”

<h4 id="sec-1-1-8"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.8</span> The Great Experiment</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-8">
<p>
Altogether it's mostly an experiment: can we use AI characters to help
the players create their own stories that aren't “a war?”
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Eve  has shown  that players  can organize  themselves to  create a
story  built  around  war;  but  we  can  enforce  a  Shapir-Whorff
hypothesis in a game world. You lack the vocabulary in the language
of  actions  presented  to  you  as a  player  to  conduct  literal
violence.  There  are no  swords.  So,  will players  devolve  into
bullies in  some other way, and  end up creating their  own war? Or
will  they  find  a  way  to tell  more  interesting  stories  with
their play?
</li>

<li>So  many stories we  do tell  are simple and  non-violent. Romantic
comedies.  Sitcoms.  Even  horror  classics  are  not  “about”  the
violence;  even   in  action  films,   the  violence  is   often  a
filler. Given a vocabulary of  activities that tends to push toward
creativity and  forbids violence, will players  use that creativity
and keep coming back? or will they feel like “what this game really
needs is to let me kill the ogres?”

<h4 id="sec-1-1-9"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.9</span> The danger</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-9">
<p>
Nonetheless, there is a certain amount of “danger” necessary.
</p>

<p>
Having someone trash your garden because you didn't stop him from
coming into your neighbourhood, or ogres steal your furniture, or
something making you unable to do things in the world are forms of
“hurting” you that mean you have consequences of your actions, but you
can't just “shoot him with a BFG-2000,” you need to find a way to
“trick” him or convince him to somehow be beneficial.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1-10" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-1-10"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.10</span> Major Point: Sidekicks</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-10">
<p>
The Sidekick model (bring along a player who hasn't registered
themself; they share your inventory) might help lure more players in,
particularly with the low barrier to start playing (Click this link in
Firefox, and you're in the game now)
</p>

<p>
With some  luck, that means  we could grow  the player base  better as
people  use their  existing social  networks [literal  or digital]  to
expose  the game  to more  people, particularly  kids. Tootsville  4's
registration took about 4 minutes. This  brings it down to almost zero
effort to join  in, if you know  an existing player. It  also makes me
hope that  most new players  will see the  benefits of having  a guide
with them, so we won't have to worry so much about tutorial needs.
</p>

<p>
Bonus: marketing: “play the game with your kids” and so forth.
</p>

Analogy:  “girlfriend   mode”  was  the  nickname   for  options  like
<a href="http://zeldawiki.org/Tingle_Tuner">http://zeldawiki.org/Tingle_Tuner</a>  which allowed  a  second player  to
“help” without having to “commit” to playing an 80-hour-long RPG.

I have no solid idea how we could hope to make any money doing this.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Selling items? But then, can't people cheat by buying things for
USD$ rather than earning them in game?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Paying to clone an item that you have earned, e.g. if you have
multiple characters? to give to a friend?  
</li>

<li>Cosmetic items only?  Charge them 50¢ to dye their clothing?
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Subscription? :-P I doubt that could be a good idea.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hibernation charge?  Protect your  character from entropy. Pay us
$1 to freeze time when you're not logged in.  No need to mow your
lawn. But: it breaks the  shared, persistent world model. Need an
in-game excuse for this to work.
</li>

<li>Merchandising

</ul>

<p>
There's no profit model
</p>

<p>
OTOH, the hosting  costs should be pretty light and  it's a fun hobby,
so  I'm  willing to  dump  a  certain amount  towards  it  for my  own
amusement &amp;  my friends'; and,  maybe we  can sell enough  manuals and
coffee mugs on Cafe Press to pay the hosting bill.
</p>

<p>
There's not  much of a  marketing model,  which is why  Tootsville 1-4
ultimately failed. “Word of mouth” takes longer than “pay your hosting
bill” will accept.  The ideas of the Manifesto might  be unique enough
that we could  luck out and get Slashdotted by  someone like Upworthy,
but I wouldn't want to count on it.
</p>

<p>
Without solving these  two, I wouldn't want to  accept any investment,
meagre or  otherwise, because  it's being  built, realistically,  as a
money pit.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps getting someone to pay me (us)  to do this over again for them
is the real profit model.

<p>
Maybe we get a better royalty split and a better revenue model (more
adult players or more affluent players) and create something that's
more marketable/profitable.

The  world itself  will  be largely  3D polygonal,  but  with lots  of
"billboard" elements.  The opposite of  how FF-VII did it,  where they
had painted backgrounds and 3D characters.
</p>

<p>
If I  have to create new  avatars, they might be  low-poly 3D instead,
and fuck the 2D part.
</p>

<p>
The camera is permanently fixed looking  down, and to the "north." So,
we never see the north-facing side  of anything, ever. This also means
that the billboarded graphics won't look as silly.
</p>

<p>
If I  could afford to recreate  everything in "real" 3D,  I'd consider
it, but this seems like the  best "cheat" for now, and the performance
should be  good even on  (for example)  cheap Android tablets.  But, I
might have to  use a native (Java or binary)  client to get reasonable
3D on them. Not sure yet.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-2">
<p>
The UI is JUST A UI. There's no real game-logic on the UI side, except
for knowing how to interact with the user.
</p>

<p>
If  I get  a  chance to  rewrite  it for  other  platforms, then,  all
the better.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol"><li>Basic Screen layout<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-5-2-1">
<p>
The UI  is all one-finger; we  look for taps/clicks, and  drags. Mouse
buttons 2 &amp; 3 should be ignored for now (this includes trapping button
3 so it can't throw up a context menu)
</p>


<p>
In the four corners of the screen we have the four main controls:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>equipped item;  tap to  "use" it;  what that  means depends  on the
item; also mapped to the Spacebar
</li>

<li>a "status"  icon to bring  up various things,  including inventory;
also mapped to the Escape key and Tab key.

<p>
Probably  derived from  the equipment  icon but  with some  kind of
player-avatar representation in it.
</p>
</li>

<li>a "face/step"  control. Tap  once to  turn to  face a  direction (8
ways); tap when already facing that way to take 1 step. Also mapped
to  the  cursor   keys  and  the  numeric   keypad  (digits  except
5). Basically meant  to look like a gamepad stick  and be easier to
“tap”   to  move   in   narrow  spaces   or  turn-to-face   without
actually walking.
</li>

<li>"Action"  control. Depends  on  context. Think  the  (A) button  in
Ocarina  of Time.  Also mapped  to  Enter, Return,  or the  numeric
keypad 5  key. A small "side"  icon (which jumps up  and takes over
when you're near someone) is for "say something" all the time. (See
"tap and talk") 
</li>
</ul>


<p>
For a11y we  may need/want to be  able to cluster these in  one or two
corners,   also.  I   have  some   ideas  about   giving  pre-arranged
re-arrangements for  this for  users who  (a) are  using a  tablet and
holding it from  the bottom corners (thumby controls) and  (b) who are
using some kind of pointer (say,  a trackball) where it's difficult to
move  across  the  width  of  the   screen,  so  they  want  them  all
combined together.

Tap on the ground to move to a position, using pathfinding.

<p>
"Usable  items" &#x2014;  you can  only  equip one  item to  the button  at
a time.
</p>

<p>
Items  can have  continuous (percentage-full)  or discrete  (countable
number)  quantities associated  with them;  both  have a  "max" and  a
"current" amount. This was done in Romance 1.1 as well.
</p>

<p>
Items can be "targeted," "directed," or "directional," or "immediate."
</p>

<p>
TARGETED:  Click  on   a  specific  entity  to   affect.  Click  item;
click entity.  Entity should “highlight”  when mouse over  to indicate
that it's eligible for selection. Gamepad: L-target then “Fire”
</p>

<p>
DIRECTED: Click on a coördinate; tries  to affect that point in space,
regardless  of  whether  there  is   any  entity  there.  Click  item;
click  space.  Cursor  should  be  a “ball”  of  some  kind.  Gamepad:
R-stick aim? 
</p>

<p>
DIRECTIONAL:  Click   to  set  a  direction,   relative  to  yourself;
e.g.  click up  top-left when  standing at  center screen  means, "aim
north-westerly"  Click  item,  then   position  pointer  “around”  the
character; should  maybe show a  vector moving parallel to  the ground
plane in  the chosen direction  toward infinity to indicate  this mode
of selection. Gamepad: R-stick aim?
</p>

<p>
IMMEDIATE: Click to use, here, now. No second click.

"walkable  spaces" are  totally different  in this  model, plus  we're
going to have server-side physics, so there.
</p>


<p>
"walkable"  surfaces =  defined  by interaction  of  character type  +
surface;  always  must be  a  "real"  3D  surface (not  a  billboarded
object); generally defines as  "navigable" "difficult" or "impassible"
for the character; the client shouldn't need to know this stuff.
</p>

<p>
The character will pathfind "navigable" before "difficult" usually.
</p>

<p>
eg:  "navigable" terrain  = flat  earth. "difficult"  terrain =  loose
sand, or steep incline uphill. "impassible"  might be a wall. They may
be able to jump it, but they should usually walk around.

Character "adrenaline" v "exertion" scale similar to Skyward Sword. If
you  start going  acrobatics (e.g.  navigating difficult  terrain) the
"adrenaline" scale  goes up,  so you'll accept  the "penalty"  to your
exertion scale and  use the more difficult route (e.g.  jumping over a
small wall) rather than walking around.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p>
Some equipment are clothes. All clothes are equipment.
</p>

<p>
Equipment can:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>have  a  passive effect;  simply  equipping  it  allows it  to  "do
something"
</li>

<li>have  an active  effect; this  usually  means it  becomes the  item
mapped to your "current item" button.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Slots:  are  like  "shirt/chest"  "pants/groin"  "left  hand"  and  so
forth. Items are only equippable in certain slots.
</p>

<p>
Valences: Some  things can be stacked  within a slot. Like,  you could
maybe have a character wearing
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>body paint (pattern layer)
</li>
<li>pasties
</li>
<li>bra
</li>
<li>undershirt
</li>
<li>shirt
</li>
<li>waistcoast
</li>
<li>jacket
</li>
<li>overcoat
</li>
<li>cape
</li>
</ul>

<p>
… all of these taking the "shirt" slot. Some of them block other slots
at the same valence though. Like, the  cape might have a hoot and thus
extend into a "hat" slot. The "pattern" might cover the whole body. &amp;c
</p>

<p>
The avatar "exports" its slots. The item "imports" them.
</p>

<p>
Basic "DON/DOFF" commands.
</p>

<p>
Hot-swap icon  for equipment on  a "swipe?"  Hide one icon  behind the
other and "swipe" to swap them? worth considering.

In real life it takes a second to swap items, so no worries if it does
in the game, too.

Multiple servers running lightweight containers
</p>

<p>
Containers  win for  sharing  mmapped regions  of  RO content  between
themselves  so we  don't lose  anything  if we  run multiple  "logical
servers"  on  one  "physical"  (possibly   also  a  VM,  e.g.  Amazon)
server.  And  we  just  design  each one  to  run  in  a  dead-minimal
environment all by itself, no  worries about other services running on
the same host.
</p>

<p>
Game core itself  = monolithic executable that  sniffs its environment
and command-line  to decide which task  to do on that  instance; thus,
lots of shared  RO storage, and so  much of a game  server is overhead
logic stuff that there isn't much of a ballooning either way.
</p>


<p>
Message  Queue  =  leaning  toward ZeroMQ  or  RabbitMQ.  No  opinions
yet. Need to research. Main question, which  is easier to set up for a

There are a team of characters who provide the basic story-movement
capabilities for the game designers. They'll have the most developed
personalities and are regarded as being particularly “special” by all
of the other AI's.
</p>

<p>
They're also the original group that arrived first.
</p>

<p>
These basic characters also serve as models that players can
(hopefully) identify-with; and, by virtue of building their
personality types, other characters will in turn be able to exhibit
features of them.
</p>

<p>
They're the archetypes, from which all AI's descend.
</p>

<p>
They're intentionally based upon the models of how (we wish) players
will interact with the world, thus by merely existing and
participating, themselves, we'll see a continuous test of the game
world's ability to withstand players.
</p>

<p>
The current working models here have been drawn from the elemental
system of Chinese astrology as well as various psychological
documentation with a bit more scientific rigour; the various
categories will likely be merged into fewer characters as we
develop them.

Most Earth-type people are trustful, steady, loyal and

<p>
The characteristics of Earth are standing still, being slow and
steady, and stationary. Therefore the Earth people don't like to move
their body and change their mind too often. They are honest,
trustworthy, and responsible. They also have good faith. They can sit
in one position for a long time. They accept religion since they like
rumination and meditation. They are slow to react. They like to
collect things, and enjoy their collectables at home, but
not outdoors.
</p>

<p>
People lacking Earth are selfish, insincere, and self-indulgent. They
tend to ignore other people's opinions. They might take immediate
advantage of others unethically. They don't care about the people

Metal-type people are righteous, faithful, gallant and

<p>
Metal is the substance in which internal particles squeeze and
condense together. There is a force from the outside to the inside
that keeps Metal hard. Metal reflects light, so it is shiny. It may
have a clear sound when it's hit. Therefore, a Metal-type person has
great strength, discipline and enough courage to aid needy people,
which may make them famous.
</p>

<p>
Metal people are brave, disciplined, trained, organized,
authoritative, determinative, routine, firm, resolute and have an
urge to win. They have a large sense of honor. They like to spread
their fame. They are sensitive in grief and sadness.
</p>

<p>
People that lack Metal are quiet, cautious and nervous. They tend to
think too much, and cannot make quick decisions. They do not express
what is on their minds in public, but will complain about
something afterwards.

brave but may have no resourcefulness and no intelligence. They have
little grace and no mercy. They do not keep secrets.

aggressively when growing up. Because of the characteristics of
trees, Wood-type people are steadfast, organized, logical, practical,
innovative, unique, assertive, fortitudinous, independent,
challenging and direct. They like to plan things, take action, and go
on adventures and challenges. They are perfectionists who tend to
push themselves to the limit and seek out the best, and take first
place in competition.

<p>
When their ambition and optimism is overwhelming, Wood-types can
become upset, nervous, unstable, impatient, intolerant, and lose
their humor by the frustration of many obstacles.

People lacking Wood essentially are weak in their opinions. They lack
the determination to change their options when situations
change. They are likely to be jealous when they don't have a strong

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-8">
<p>
Killers like to provoke and cause drama and/or impose them over other
players in the scope provided by the virtual world. Trolls, hackers,
cheaters, and attention farmers belong in this category, along with
the most ferocious and skillful PvP (player versus player) opponents.
</p>

<p>
Artisan/Killer: Finally, there are the Killers (or, as I prefer to
call them, Manipulators). These can be difficult to understand in a
gameplay context because most virtual worlds have encoded rules that
marginalize their play style as "griefing" (i.e., upsetting other
players) and try to prevent it. As Bartle puts it, "Killers get their
kicks from imposing themselves on others." He also points out that
Killers "wish only to demonstrate their superiority over
fellow humans."
</p>

<p>
This desire for power over everything in their world is most closely
echoed in the Keirseian description of Artisans, who (as their
temperament name suggests) delight in the skillfully artistic
manipulation of their environment. The Artisan/Killers are the
tool-users, the adrenaline junkies, the natural politicians, the
combat pilots, the high-stakes gamblers, and the negotiators
par excellence. They instinctively find and exploit advantages in any
tactical situation, and they express this need for dominance of their
world in order to retain the greatest amount of personal freedom
possible (External Change).
</p>

<p>
I believe a very good example of this can be found in Ryan
Creighton's "social engineering" of the coin-collecting game at the
Social Game Developers Rant of the 2011 Game Developers Conference. A
Guardian/Achiever would have played by the rules and raced around the
room begging others for their coins to try to win the game; an
Idealist/Socializer would have asked for coins as a way to meet new
people or help others win; and a Rational/Explorer would have sat
quietly watching the flow of coin exchanges to try to understand the
nature of the game. But an Artisan/Killer would instantly see how to
short-circuit the designed system, and, as a born negotiator, would
find it easy to persuade the person holding one of the bags of coins
to hand the whole thing over&#x2026; which is exactly what happened.
</p>

<p>
If the attendees needed to hear a rant from anyone, it would be the
Manipulator who is out there, just waiting to exploit any opportunity
to bring a little chaos to the carefully designed order of a
social game. (See Ryan's description of the event for a wonderful
first-hand account of gameplay from what appears to me to be a
classic Artisan/Killer perspective.)
</p>

<p>
A final note on the Keirsey/Bartle linkage: the Keirsey temperaments
and Bartle Types may appear not to line up directly where attitudes
toward other people are concerned. This is because the Bartle Types
were developed within a multi-player environment, which selects for
more extroverted, sociable gamers, while the temperaments include
both extroverts and introverts.
</p>

<p>
So, for example, the "Socializer" term that makes sense within the
Bartle Types for its emphasis on interacting with other people can
seem not to apply to an introverted Idealist who prefers to play
single-player games. These less-social Socializers are more likely to
prefer individualized entertainment or abstract games, making it
difficult to distinguish them from Rational/Explorer gamers. Closer
study is usually required to see whether their primary reason for
playing is to feel good (an Idealist preference) or to exercise their
thinking skills (a Rational goal).

<h4 id="sec-2-2-9"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.9</span> <span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> achiever person</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-9">
<p>
Achievers are competitive and enjoy beating difficult challenges
whether they are set by the game or by themselves. The more
challenging the goal, the most rewarded they tend to feel.
</p>

<p>
Guardian/Achiever: For the Guardian, the world is an insecure place,
so it's necessary to protect oneself by accumulating material
possessions&#x2026; just in case. Thus, Guardians focus on earning money,
on competing with others for resources perceived as scarce, on buying
nice things and maintaining them, on forming stable and hierarchical
group relationships, and generally on working hard to make their
place in the world secure by locking down their connections to the
world as possessions (External Structure).
</p>

<p>
Compare that to Bartle's description of Achievers: "Achievers regard
points-gathering and rising in levels as their main goal" and
"Achievers are proud of their formal status in the game's built-in
level hierarchy, and of how short a time they took to reach it."
Leveling up, leaderboards, and the accumulation of vast quantities of
looted items are all behaviors that are driven more by a
security-seeking motivation than by other motivations such as
powerful sensations, understanding or self-growth.
</p>

<p>
This explains why the Guardian/Achiever is willing to persist in long
stretches of "grind" that other kinds of gamers don't perceive as fun
at all. To this gamer, rewards should be proportional to the amount of
effort invested. When a game is designed around simple, well-defined
tasks that enable the competitive accumulation of status tokens, that
game is virtually guaranteed to attract security-seeking
Guardian/Achievers.

<p>
Explorers like to explore the world – not just its geography but also
the finer details of the game mechanics. These players may end up
knowing how the game works and behave better than the game
creators themselves. They know all the mechanics, short-cuts, tricks,
and glitches that there are to know in the game and thrive on
discovering more.
</p>

<p>
Rational/Explorer: Rationals play in the same way that they do
everything else &#x2013; they find pleasure in discovering the organized
structural patterns behind raw data (Internal Structure). These can
be patterns in space (as in geography) or patterns in time (as in
morphology). Or they can be cause-and-effect patterns (entailment) or
relationship patterns (connections). Ultimately, it's all about
achieving a strategic understanding of the system as a whole thing.
</p>

<p>
As Bartle describes Explorers: "The real fun comes only from
discovery, and making the most complete set of maps in existence." Of
the core motivations &#x2013; sensation-seeking, security-seeking,
knowledge-seeking, and identity-seeking &#x2013; exploration as "discovery"
is most closely aligned with the Rational's
knowledge-seeking preference. For the Rational/Explorer, once the
principle behind the data is revealed, that's enough &#x2013; understanding
is its own reward. These gamers can enjoy imparting knowledge to
others, but no extrinsic reward for doing so is needed or expected.

<p>
Socializers are often more interested in having relations with the
other players than playing the game itself. They help to spread
knowledge and a human feel, and are often involved in the community
aspect of the game (by means of managing guilds or role-playing, for
instance).
</p>

<p>
Idealist/Socializer: Socializers are described by Bartle as
"&#x2026; interested in people, and what they have to
say. &#x2026; Inter-player relationships are important &#x2026; seeing [people]
grow as individuals, maturing over time. &#x2026; The only ultimately
fulfilling thing is &#x2026; getting to know people, to understand them,
and to form beautiful, lasting relationships."
</p>

<p>
This is closely related to the Keirseian description of Idealists,
who are very aware of other people as part of their lifelong journey
of self-discovery (Internal Change). In a way, the highly imaginative
Idealists are always roleplaying; they are constantly creating images
of themselves (or others) that they feel they should model through
their own actions in order to produce the emotions in themselves that
they want to feel.

The fiero-seeking Conqueror is the economic mainstay of the upper
market of videogames, thriving on a diet rich in First
Person Shooters. Challenge is the draw for this player – when the
complaint “it was too easy” is heard, it is heard from a
Conqueror. Fiero, the emotion of “triumph over adversity” requires
that the player be put through the ringer, pushed to their limits,
and as a result anger and (possibly) fear are likely to be
related emotions. It is likely that Conquerors are younger on average
than other players.

The strategic-minded manager is a complexity-seeking player. Games

are the mainstay of such a player, although adventure games will also
be enjoyed by many. Although fiero is likely to be a theme, the
Manager is less dependent upon this one emotion, and seeks the
satisfaction of knowledge or mastery, expressed through the feeling
of contentment. They can rack up serious hours on the games they

indeed the desire to know how the story ends may drive engagement
with any game. Fear may be enjoyed for the experience, in the manner
of a fairground spook house.

<p>
The archetypal social player, the Participant doesn’t want to
play alone. Although competition (agon) is enjoyed, it is enjoyed
principally for the opportunity to be part of something taking place
between people. The need to belong, to be part of something, is
likely to be expressed most strongly with such a player.

as MMORPGs, the Hoarder is a thorough player, gaining satisfaction
(and hence contentment) from the completion of “stamp collections”
and the like. When they finish a game, they usually find they have
accumulated an absurd amount of equipment, ammunition or money.

Puzzle games are the zoner’s remit – lost in the flow of an abstract
game, they become intent upon the actions of the game they are
playing to the exclusion of all else. However, as much as they love
the games they play, they may not play for long period of
times. Short games played often is the nature of the experience.

The Juggernaut seeks a little resistance in the game they are

(and amusing!) ease. A little excitement is desired, but the
Juggernaut isn’t looking for the degree of challenge that would
consistently supply fiero. Rather, they just want to play around –
often completely dominating the game they are playing. For the
Juggernaut, games aren’t about stress, they’re about unwinding.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Originally planned for Tootsville IV, but we never got decent art and
then the client-side support blew up. Yay Sam.
</p>

<p>
Mazes exist as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>lilypads across the lake near the treehouses where the finches live
</li>

<li>lava floes in the caves into the Lost World
</li>

<li>under The Manor, Venetian theme; Venice, Roman catacombs, or the
Temple Of The Gods in Wind Waker.
</li>

<li>The Manor maybe also a hedge maze
</li>

<li>something like a maze around the Ranch?
</li>

<li>going down hamster tubes on the space station
</li>

<li>traversing a Coral Reef near the Manatee village &#x2026;
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The Maze areas are made up of “tile”-like objects that are either
“positive” (places one <b>can</b> walk) or “negative” (one can only walk
where they are <b>not</b>); e.g. lilypads are a positive-space maze; hedge
mazes are negative-space; lava floes might be a combination of both,
with positive-space islands amid negative-space lava amid
positive-space.
</p>

<p>
Before a space transitions, there's an obvious transitional state;
e.g. lily pads partially submerged/arisen.
</p>

<p>
Some spaces may be “dangerous” and reset the player to something like
the start of the maze, but will have obvious “hints” to warn the
player of this.
</p>

<p>
Over time, the dynamic stepping stones are changed slightly: one
might appear or disappear randomly.
</p>

<p>
Stones won't disappear or become dangerous while someone is
standing upon them?
</p>

<p>
Keys and locked doors (of whatever kinds) may exist in each maze
</p>

<pre class="example">
The Locked Door can only be opened if the player possesses the
Key Pivitz and is standing nearby to it, within a
predefined area. Once unlocked, the Key is "destroyed" [but
therefore can be obtained again], and the door remains unlocked
[and passable] as long as the player remains nearby. Once the
player leaves the area [either by walking away or walking through
the door], the door locks again, requiring someone [same or other
player] find the Key to the door again.
</pre>

<p>
doors can also be teleports
</p>

<pre class="example">
The exits from each room re-enter other maze rooms more-or-less
at random: they are not laid out in a grid, and walking back
through the same door may not return you to the same room. Doors
may change where they go over time, perhaps daily or hourly.
</pre>

<p>
Possible alternate Key/Lock mechanism might be to obtain a Key and
require it to go to a Lock elsewhere in the maze, which then opens a
door distant from the lock for a given time (say, 5 minutes or
so).
</p>

<p>
NPC hinting, per the old Tootsville IV plan it went like
</p>

<pre class="example">
A Super Toot Bot will stand just inside the entrance from the
Castle with a short phrasebook explaining the basic rules, e.g.:
    The maze is changing all the time.
    If you can find the key, there's a prize behind the
    locked door.
    Watch out for slippery stones or you might be sent to
    Shaddow Falls!
    If you get lost, use your Compass to escape.
    Run away if you see The Big Bad! He'll steal your peanuts!
</pre>

<p>
Upsides: serves puzzle-solving players; fairly good replayability
</p>

<p>
Downsides: requires new assets [prizes, rooms] to be added from time
to time.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">
<p>
One idea: columns of ants marching in. The "towers" throw
ant-foodstuffs at them: seeds and such. When the ants have "absorbed"
enough "hit points" [carbs?] worth of food, they turn around and
march peacefully away. "Sated" ants change colors and move faster;
they're not targeted by the weapons.
</p>

<p>
The player's "base," then, is a picnic basket, with a certain number
of peanuts in it. As the ants successfully take peanuts, they are
"sated" and rush off screen. Once the entire picnic has been stolen
by the ants, the game ends.
</p>

<p>
Since kids crave closure, we could have the game "end" after a
certain number of rounds.
</p>

<p>
This could be done now [Nightmare] as a minigame, or later [Osiris]
as an in-world game.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-6">
<p>
This was a knock-off of Astro-Pop.
</p>

<p>
Basically:
</p>

<p>
Move spaceship left or right across bottom of board.
</p>

<p>
Use "tractor beam" to pull down blocks which are the same
color. Collect blocks from one or more columns, then push them back
into another column by dropping them.
</p>

<p>
When enough blocks of the same colour collide, they "pop," and trigger
any adjacent special blocks to drop their prizes as well.
</p>

<p>
Note that the implementation of the pattern-search for the blocks
array was something that PopCap? did very badly in their first
implementation of this game, so we should watch out for "gotchas"
in that.
</p>

<p>
We could probably invert the screen vertically and have this as a
digging game. The blocks would be various chunks of earth; moving them
together causes little "cave ins." The prizes are carried up out of
the earth by grateful bugs [earthworms, ladybirds, etc.] to the player
walking across a scaffold at the top of the screen. The players could
them collect a certain type of prizes as a goal, once they receive
enough of these [gems?] they could move on to a higher level.

<p>
The only difficulties we had in production of Zuma from PopCap? were:
asynchronous ball-rolling animations in the axis of forward travel
tended to cost a lot of CPU power; we went to a synchronous, general
animation for the seat-back systems; and the tunnels code gave
me trouble.

"Feed fish; fight aliens."
</p>

<p>
The bear kids were stoned or something, but it's an addictive
format. We should probably rework it into something other than an
aquarium, of course.
</p>

<p>
Basically, you drop fish-food into the tank, to feed the fish, who in
turn both grow, and crap out gold coins. Clicking coins collects them,
to give you money, to buy more fish [and some other helpful creatures
that assist in feeding and collecting coins].
</p>

From time to time, aliens beam into the tank, and you click on them
to LASER them until they explode back to their alien universe.

<p>
Consideration: Perhaps not The Big Bad himself. I don't want to introduce
the character too early and end up making him a mere nuisance.

<p>
Perhaps having Targ or Welduh or something do this kind of harassment
makes more sense.

From 2009, I wrote:
</p>

<p>
9.6 Shopping
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Shopping is  now an  in-world action.  If desired,  storekeepers can
even be conversant NPC:s.
</li>

<li>Players can walk  through shops and view items on  shelves, and then
purchase them by  clicking on the items and choosing  to buy them or
not. When clicked upon, store items  will pop up a detail sub-window
similar to the previous “web catalog” views.
</li>

<li>This gains  us the  additional psychological advantage  that players
will  literally see  “everything” for  sale, rather  than only  ever
seeing a few items at a time. This makes the shops look much bigger,
even though  from an artwork perspective  we only need to  draw [and
then replicate] a couple of “shelves” graphics.
</li>

<li>None  of the  shopping  functions require  special  handling on  the
client side, since  the stores are just ordinary 3D  rooms with some
special logic  on the server  side to handle purchasing  items [and,
possibly, speaking with the clarks at the stores].
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We didn't really live up to it at the time, but the examples of
actually trying to do so in Tootsville (like Capes &amp; Cowls) seemed to
validate the statement.

Aegades islands, in Largo di Torre Argentina, Rome.
</p>

<p>
He was elected as a consul in 242 BC, a novus homo. During his
consulship he supervised the construction of a new Roman fleet. This
fleet was funded by donations from wealthy citizens, since the public
treasury was virtually empty. He then led the fleet into victory over
Hanno the Great's Carthaginian fleet in the Battle of the
Aegates Islands. This was the decisive battle of the First Punic
War. To celebrate his victory, he built a temple to Juturna in Campus
Martius, in the area currently known as Largo di Torre Argentina.

<p>
particularly they might not cope well with the ADVANCED mode of
Closure Compiler so we might want to minify them with a gentler
setting and then use ADVANCED for our own code, where it'll be easier
to fix it when it breaks (e.g. adding JSDoc annotations or being
careful about using dot-accessors versus string-accessors)
