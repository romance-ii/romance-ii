  Downloading Knowledgebase Data Sources
 ————————————————————————————————————————

This process will take a long time, and a lot of bandwidth and disc space.

I do mean “a lot.” The current set of data sources pulled is more than
${SIZE}GiB of general knowledge data — and most of that is in compressed
(gzip or bzip2) files.  At least here in 2016, that's a lot of stuff.

These data sources are used to prepare the knowledgebase for the artificial
intelligence and natural language interfaces.  This process will not be
repeated if the upstream sources have not changed, though, and will resume
if interrupted relatively nicely. 

If you have to stop this and change your mind later, don't panic; just run
$0 in $(pwd) again.

It would be nice to build a torrent source for the assembled data so that it
can be redistributed without taxing the upstream sources, but that is part
of what we're aiming to do with this, eventually.

cat <<END

Some of the downloading (particularly DBpedia) will take place in background
processes and try to saturate your downstream.  Once the other (smaller)
downloads are complete, you'll see progress reports every few minutes until
that completes.  If you must kill it, look at the list of background
processes it's watching to see what else to kill; eg:

   pgrep -af wget | grep dbpedia

If you really aren't planning on seeding the knowledgebase from these
encyclopædic sources, you don't need to do this.

You can abort now, or at any time… I'll wait a few seconds to let you brace
yourself …

 Congratulations!  If you've survived this far, you're into the home
stretch.

 Those DBPedia downloads are probably still running.  They do have
checksums, though, so what we're going to do, now, is wait for them all to
check out.  When that's happened, we can be reasonably sure that we have the
full set downloaded.

 Depending on your connection speed, this might take a while.  It'll recheck
every few minutes.  Expect to see a string of checksum failures until the
parallel downloads all finish up.
