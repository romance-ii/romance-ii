/**
 * <p>
 * This is a simple marker interface which is used to identify a data
 * record which is, in turn, a collection of other data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There was originally an intention to provide separate factory methods
 * to facilitate sets of this type. However, it was discovered that the
 * {@link DataRecord} class was sufficient to the purpose, and permitted
 * more flexibility in the implementation details of the backing store.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface was, therefore, reduced to a marker interface for
 * convenience purposes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A default implementation sufficient for most purposes is being
 * developed as {@link SimpleDataRecordSet}. As of the writing (Appius
 * 1.1, July 2010), no great effort has been expended toward completing
 * this base class simply because there is no active consumer of the
 * type.
