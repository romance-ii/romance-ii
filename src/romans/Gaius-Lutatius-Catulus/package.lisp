Gaius Lutatius Catulus [Latin: C·LVTATIVS·C·F·CATVLVS] was a Roman
statesman and naval commander in the First Punic War.  Temple to
Juturna, built by Catulus to celebrate his victory at Aegades islands,
in Largo di Torre Argentina, Rome.

He was elected as a consul in 242 BC, a NOVVS·HŌMŌ. During his
consulship he supervised the construction of a new Roman fleet. This
fleet was funded by donations from wealthy citizens, since the public
treasury was virtually empty. He then led the fleet into victory over
Hanno the Great's Carthaginian fleet in the Battle of the Aegates
Islands. This was the decisive battle of the First Punic War. To
celebrate his victory, he built a temple to Juturna in Campus Martius,
in the area currently known as Largo di Torre Argentina.")
