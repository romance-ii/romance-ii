<h1>Building simple planners in Lisp</h1>

This is the home of a few simple Lisp planning systems intended for
classroom use:

<ul>
<li> <b>simple-GP</b>, a simplified implementation of Blum and Furst's
GraphPlan.
<li> <b>simple-GP-CSP</b>, a refinement of simple-GP that extracts solutions
  using constraint satisfaction.
<li> <b>simple-SAT</b>, a different refinement of simple-GP (based on
  Kautz and Selman) that translates a planning graph into a
  satisfiability problem and uses the DPLL algorithm to find
  solutions.
<li> <b>simple-HSP</b>, a heuristic search planner patterned after
  Bonet and Geffner's HSP2.
<li> <b>simple-POP</b>, an implementation of a partial-order planner.
 The basic version handles propositional actions; an extension handles
 actions with variable bindings.
</ul>

These simple planners were developed for (and within) a course on
artificial intelligence programming.  Credits for design and
implementation, before revision, go to Mike Dickheiser (simple-GP),
Stephen G. Ware (simple-GP-CSP and simple-SAT), and David Boyuka
(simple-HSP).  The planners generally follow the discussion in Stuart
Russell and Peter Norvig's
<i>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</i>, 2nd edition
(<a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">AIMA</a>).  The planners run
using the Lisp code supplied with either AIMA or Peter
Norvig's <i>Paradigms of AI Programming: Case Studies in Common
Lisp</i> (<a href="http://norvig.com/paip.html">PAIP</a>).

<p>
The focus of the planners is on clarity rather than efficiency.  This
means that, in comparison with their heavy-duty research counterparts,
all the simple planners are stripped to the essentials and are very
slow.  In compensation, the planners are small and understandable.
They run side-by-side in the same environment.  Each planner can be
presented in a single lecture, concepts and code.  I've found that
students with half a semester of Lisp instruction can usefully test,
compare, and modify the systems in homework assignments or projects.

<p>
All the planners can be used with the PAIP or AIMA Lisp code, or
without either.  It's possible that bugs are present in the planners,
but they currently produce reasonable results.  All the planners pass
simple tests in Clozure and Lispworks Personal (Mac OS X, 10.4, on my
aging PowerBook).  It should be trivial to port the code if it does
not run already.

<p>
If you have questions about the code, would like to contribute changes
or bug fixes, or would simply like to say that you find it useful,
please send email to the author, Rob St. Amant
(<a href="mailto:stamant@csc.ncsu.edu">stamant@csc.ncsu.edu</a>).<p>

<h2>Getting started </h2>

<ol>
<li> Get the code for the simple planners:<p>

   <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/stamant/simple-planners.zip">http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/stamant/simple-planners.zip</a><p>

<li> Follow the installation instructions
  in <a href="./simple-README.txt"><tt>simple-README.txt</tt></a>.<p>


<li> Start your Lisp environment.  Load the system and test the
  planners.  A few domains and problems are loaded automatically with
  the system.  Two domain examples, plus associated problems:

<pre>
;;; In simple-problems.lisp [AIMA, p. 388]
(define (domain socks-and-shoes)
  (:action Right-Shoe :precond Right-Sock-On :effect Right-Shoe-On)
  (:action Right-Sock :precond nil :effect Right-Sock-On)
  (:action Left-Shoe :precond Left-Sock-On :effect Left-Shoe-On)
  (:action Left-Sock :precond nil :effect Left-Sock-On))

(define (problem put-on-shoes)
    (:domain socks-and-shoes)
  (:init)
  (:goal (and Right-Shoe-On Left-Shoe-On)))

;;; In simple-problems.lisp [AIMA p. 380]
(define (domain cargo)
  (:action Load
           :parameters (?c ?p ?a)
           :precond (and (At ?c ?a) (At ?p ?a) (Cargo ?c) (Plane ?p) (Airport ?a))
           :effect (and (not (At ?c ?a)) (In ?c ?p)))
  (:action Unload
           :parameters (?c ?p ?a)
           :precond (and (In ?c ?p) (At ?p ?a) (Cargo ?c) (Plane ?p) (Airport ?a))
           :effect (and (At ?c ?a) (not (In ?c ?p))))
  (:action Fly
           :parameters (?p ?from ?to) 
           :precond (and (At ?p ?from) (Plane ?p) (Airport ?from) (Airport ?to))
           :effect (and (not (At ?p ?from)) (At ?p ?to))))

(define (problem deliver-no-return)
  (:domain cargo)
  (:objects C1 SFO P1 JFK)
  (:init (At C1 SFO) (At P1 SFO)
         (Cargo C1) (Plane P1)
         (Airport JFK) (Airport SFO))
  (:goal (At C1 JFK)))

(define (problem back-and-forth)
  (:domain cargo)
  (:objects C1 C2 SFO P1 P2 JFK)
  (:init (At C1 SFO) (At C2 JFK) (At P1 SFO) (At P2 JFK)
         (Cargo C1) (Cargo C2) (Plane P1) (Plane P2)
         (Airport JFK) (Airport SFO))
  (:goal (and (At C1 JFK) (At C2 SFO))))
</pre>

Given such domain and problem definitions, you can paste the following
into a Lisp listener/REPL:

<pre>
(plan (make-instance 'propositional-POP-planner) 'put-on-shoes :domain 'socks-and-shoes)
;;; returns #&lt;Plan: Left-Sock, Left-Shoe, Right-Sock, Right-Shoe&gt;
;;; Steps are linearized for printing.

(plan (make-instance 'GP-planner) 'put-on-shoes :domain 'socks-and-shoes)
;;; returns #&lt;Plan: [Right-Sock, Left-Sock]; [Right-Shoe, Left-Shoe]&gt;

;;; or, in a domain with first-order actions:

(plan (make-instance 'GP-planner) 'back-and-forth :domain 'cargo)
;;; returns #&lt;Plan: [Load(C1 P1 SFO), Load(C2 P2 JFK)]; [Fly(P2 JFK SFO), Fly(P1 SFO JFK)]; [Unload(C2 P2 SFO), Unload(C1 P1 JFK)]&gt;

(plan (make-instance 'GP-CSP-planner) 'back-and-forth :domain 'cargo)
;;; returns #&lt;Plan: [Load(C1 P1 SFO), Load(C2 P2 JFK)]; [Fly(P2 JFK SFO), Fly(P1 SFO JFK)]; [Unload(C2 P2 SFO), Unload(C1 P1 JFK)]&gt;

(plan (make-instance 'SAT-planner) 'back-and-forth :domain 'cargo)
;;; returns #&lt;Plan: [Load(C1 P1 SFO), Load(C2 P2 JFK)]; [Fly(P2 JFK SFO), Fly(P1 SFO JFK)]; [Unload(C2 P2 SFO), Unload(C1 P1 JFK)]&gt;

(plan (make-instance 'HSP-planner) 'back-and-forth :domain 'cargo)
;;; returns #&lt;Plan: Load(C2 P2 JFK), Fly(P2 JFK SFO), Unload(C2 P2 SFO), Load(C1 P2 SFO), Fly(P2 SFO JFK), Unload(C1 P2 JFK)]&gt;

(plan (make-instance 'POP-planner) 'deliver-no-return :domain 'cargo)
;;; returns #&lt;Plan: Load(C1 P1 SFO), Fly(P1 SFO JFK), Unload(C1 P1 JFK)&gt;

</pre>

There are minor differences in the plans returned by the planners, as
shown (e.g., linearized steps in simple-POP and simple-HSP plans;
levels of unordered actions in simple-GP plans).  The repeated
creation of planner instances above is not necessary for handling
different problems or domains.

<h2>Notes on the files</h2>


<p><b><a href="./simple-README.txt">simple-README.txt</a>:</b>

This file explains where the code for the planners should be installed
and how the planners can be loaded.

<p><b><a href="simple-gp.lisp">simple-gp.lisp</a></b> and <b><a href="simple-gp-csp.lisp">simple-gp-csp.lisp</a>:</b>

These two files contain the code for GraphPlan.  The basic variant
extracts solutions from a planning graph with a naive brute-force
approach; the CSP variant relies on simple constraint satisfaction.

<p><b><a href="simple-sat.lisp">simple-sat.lisp</a></b> and <b><a href="simple-sat-solver.lisp">simple-sat-solver.lisp</a>:</b>

These files contain the code for a SAT-based planner, translation
functions for conversion back and forth between a planning
representation and a SAT representation, and a DPLL-based SAT solver.

<p><b><a href="simple-hsp.lisp">simple-hsp.lisp</a>:</b>

This file contains the code for a heuristic search planner patterned
after HSP2.  simple-HSP performs a best-first search using a cost
function that ignores action delete lists.

<p><b><a href="simple-pop.lisp">simple-pop.lisp</a></b> and <b><a href="simple-pop-with-bindings.lisp">simple-pop-with-bindings.lisp</a>:</b>

These two files contains the code for the propositional partial-order
planner and an extension to handle planning with variable bindings.

<p><b><a href="simple-data-structures.lisp">simple-data-structures.lisp</a></b> and <b><a href="simple-planners.lisp">simple-planners.lisp</a>:</b>

The first file contains basic data structure definitions for the
planners: actions, plans, and so forth.  The second file contains code
for consistent invocation of the planners, using a <tt>plan</tt>
method, and code for planner-specific pre-processing of planning
problems and domains.

<p><b><a href="simple-pddl-processing.lisp">simple-pddl-processing.lisp</a>:</b>

This file contains functions for handling PDDL.  PDDL parsing is very
fragile; using domains and problems from other sources may require a
bit of work to translate them into an appropriate form.

<p><b><a href="simple-problems.lisp">simple-problems.lisp</a>:</b>

This file contains a small number of problems and their associated
domains, for testing the planners.

<p><b><a href="simple-utilities.lisp">simple-utilities.lisp</a></b>,
   <b><a href="standalone.lisp">standalone.lisp</a></b>, 
   <b><a href="aima-compatibility.lisp">aima-compatibility.lisp</a></b>, 
   <b><a href="paip-planners.lisp">paip-planners.lisp</a></b>,
   <b><a href="paip-compatibility.lisp">paip-compatibility.lisp</a></b>,
and <b><a href="paip-problems.lisp">paip-problems.lisp</a>:</b>

These files contain general utility functions and macros used by the
planners, as well as code specific to different code bases, to allow
the planning systems to run in standalone form or to run on top of the
PAIP or the AIMA code base.
