Good morning. You're in the Conversational REPL now.

I understand questions, and try to answer them, if you end them with: ?
  Where is Paris?

I accept advice about my answers, if you end it with: !
  Paris, France is not in Texas!

I learn from you, if you tell me factual statements, and end with: .
  Paris is a city.

If you want to annotate your transcript with a remark to yourself,
you can whisper by leading off with a ;
  ; This computer is dumb.

To see this help again, enter just a ? by itself.
To quit, enter: Bye!
