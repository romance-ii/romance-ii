    <h1> How to Enable WebGL in Opera </h1>
    <h2> What is WebGL? </h2>
    <p> WebGL is the graphics system that lets your web browser show
      3D graphics. </p>
    <h2> What is Opera? </h2>
    <p> Opera is a web browser. Its icon is a big red O. </p>
    <h2> Can I enable WebGL? </h2>
    <h3> For Android Devices </h3>
    <p> If you are using Opera on an Android device, WebGL should
      be enabled already. Unfortunately, if it isn't, it can't
      be changed. <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">You might be able to
        use Firefox instead.</a> You must have the <q>full</q> version of
      Opera; not the Opera Mini. </p>
    <h3> PC's with Linux, MacOS, or Windows </h3>
    <p> If you are using Opera on a PC, first, make sure that you have the
      most up-to-date version of Opera and your graphics drivers on
      your system. Then, you may need to enable WebGL in
      your Preferences. </p>
    <p> You will need to set two preference values
      to <strong><tt>1</tt></strong>. Those
      are: <a href="opera:config#Enable%20WebGL" target="enable_webgl">Enable WebGL</a> and
      <a href="opera:config#Enable%20Hardware%20Acceleration"
         target="enable_hwaccel">Enable Hardware Acceleration</a>. Change
      each preference value to one, and then
      click <strong>Save</strong>. </p>
    <p> You might also check <a href="opera:gpu">opera:gpu</a> and
      make sure that under <q>OpenGL: Blocklist status for 3D</q> your
      graphics drivers are not being blocked. </p>
