This folder is an initial, partially-functional WebGL app using some fairly ugly, non-optimized,
hand-written JavaScript cobbled together from examples in GLGE and some of my own original stuff.

It's not going to be part of the final game, per se, but I'm using it as a draft to make sure
that the Parenthetical client stuff gets working

It should be removed shortly, but for now it's going to hang around as a reference.
