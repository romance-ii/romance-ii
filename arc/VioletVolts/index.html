      <h1> Violet Volts </h1> <h2> Technology Demo </h2>

      <h3> What is this? </h3>

      <p> This page is a Technology Demo. This is <em>not</em> a
        fully-featured or playable game. In fact, this is being used as
        a <q>scratch pad</q> by the programmers. So, it's quite possible
        that it might not work; if we are testing things like the way
        that bugs are handled, in fact, we may have <q>broken</q>
        it, <em>intentionally</em>. </p>

      <h3> The Framerate Test </h3>

      <p> The current test is to judge what device(s) we might be able
        to support. Here's how it works: </p>

      <ul>
        <li> Try to visit the page linked below. </li>
        <li> If you get a message that your computer <strong>can't
          start the demo</strong>, please let us know this
          information:
          <ul>
            <li> What kind of device? (e.g. computer;
              smartphone; tablet; videogame) </li>
            <li> What kind of system is it? (e.g. <q>Samsung Galaxy
                S-III Android,</q> <q>MicroSoft Windows 8,</q> <q>Fedora
                19</q> </li>
            <li> If it's a PC, what kind of graphics processor do you have
              (if you know)? (e.g. <q>ATI Radeon,</q> <q>nVidia
                860</q>) </li>
            <li> What web browser are you using? (e.g. <q>Firefox
                20,</q> <q>Safari Mobile</q>) </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> You might want to
          visit <a href="http://get.webgl.com/">get.webgl.com</a> and
          see if there's an easy way to enable WebGL in your
          browser </li>
        <li> If your device/browser isn't capable right now, don't
          worry too much. It's possible that it will get an update
          before the game is ready to be played; or, we may be able to
          do something on our end to make it work. <strong>It is still
            helpful</strong> for us to know that you might have trouble,
          so that we can try to make it work. </li>
        <li> <strong>If you <em>can</em> start the test</strong>,
            click <strong>Log In</strong>, enter any name you like,
            and wait a while. Please <em>don't change windows or tabs
            until you finish the test,</em> because this will make it
            slow down and give you a poorer
            score. Just <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1234548/">stare
            at the screen</a> for about a minute. There really won't
            me much (if anything) to see here, except
            the <q>smiley</q> face. </li>
        <li> You'll eventually see a <q>smiley</q> appear in the top-right
          corner; after a while, a button will appear below the big
          display panel. (You might need to scroll down…) When you
          click it, a bunch of useful technical information will be
          printed. You can either click that message to send it by
          eMail automatically, or cut-n-paste it into an eMail message
          in your own way. </li>       
        <li> The <q>Player Name</q> you enter is completely ignored
          right now, but it <em>will</em> be included in the report text
          generated. So, if you would like to <q>tag</q> different
          devices, feel free to enter something
          there. (Example: <q>chrome on George's iPad</q>) </li>
        <li> If you don't <q>Log Out</q> before leaving the page,
          you'll get a warning … you can safely ignore it. </li>
      </ul>

      <p> <strong>Please send us an eMail with your
            report!</strong> <tt>
            violetvolts-frametest@star-hope.org </tt> is the
            address. </p>
