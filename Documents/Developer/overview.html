<h1> Appius Claudius Caecus </h1>

<p> First: Apologies. The documentation for this application is, at
best, fragmentary. </p>

<p> Appius Claudius Cæcus is a videogame server, and part of the
Romance application stack. Appius provides a game server and a number of facilities that
can be shared by Java-based client applications. </p>

<p> Appius was initially developed for the work-in-progress game Siderēs, but
most development at this point is being done for the principal
commercial sponsor of Appius, <a href="http://resinteractive.com/">Res Interactive, LLC</a>,
principally for the game <a href="http://www.tootsville.com/playnow">Tootsville</a>™. </p>

<h2> Starting Point Vocabulary </h2>

<p> A User is a player of the game. For COPPA registrations, a Parent
record exists to give authorization. Both a User and a Parent are
instances of an AbstractPerson, with a few basic methods. </p>

<p> A Zone contains more than one Room; except for special zones, whose
names begin with a '$', which are hidden from logins and serve special
purposes. The Zone "$Eden" is used for handling logins and giving players a list of zones.
Each Zone can be hosted on a different server. Zones are all instances
of the same original game universe. 
</p>

<p> A World is a collection of Rooms within a Zone. </p>

<p> A Room is a region of space in which events propagate. Events do not
generally pass from one room to another (e.g. speech; game actions; &amp;c.).
</p>

<p> A StoreItem is a template item; an InventoryItem is an instance
of an item that is owned by an user. </p>

<p> An Event is a specific action in-world, which can take a period of time, such
as a minigame, combat, purchase, or other activity. Events are started,
proceed through their lifetime, and are ended. Events have Outcomes,
which reward the creator of the event in some way (e.g. giving a
currency or item reward for completing a minigame). Events also have
high score lists. </p>

<p> An Action is what most programmers would call an “event,” but that would
lead to too much vocabulary confusion. Actions are registered through
the Quaestor, and can fire off script actions asynchronously. </p>

<h2> DataRecord model </h2>

<p> Most objects in the game world are instances of DataRecord. This
provides an interface for loading and saving objects to/from some kind
of backing-store. Typically, this will be an SQL database, but any
kind of storage or communications service is permissible. </p>

<p> A DataRecord is loaded <em>and saved</em> by a RecordLoader bound
to its class type through the Java “generics” system. </p>

<p> The RecordLoader for any class can be specified in the
configuration file. Default SQL-backed RecordLoaders are provided
for most classes. </p>

<p> The “universal factory” for DataRecord-based objects is the
Nomenclator class. There are specific methods for instantiating
users, because special handling is required for NPC's and such. </p>
