<h2> Privacy Policy </h2>

<p> This Privacy Policy details how we collect and use personal
information from users. </p>

<h3> Information we collect from all visitors </h3>

<p> Everyone who accesses Tootsville™ uses a computer program (such as
a web browser, eMail program, or videogame program) to access it.
This computer program will reveal certain information (“Technical
Information”) in order to work correctly. This information includes
information about the program itself, information about the type and
capabilities of the computer you are using, and information about your
Internet connection provider and speed (including your “Internet
Protocol (IP) Address”). </p>

<p> “Technical Information” is collected anonymously from everyone using
Tootsville™. This information is needed to perform services for you.
You can disable the transmission of some technical information using
the settings of your software (such as your eMail software or web
browser). Other information (such as your IP address) is absolutely
technically necessary in order to communicate. </p>

<h3> Information we collect from registered users </h3>

<p> When you register to play in Tootsville™ through our online game,
we collect your date of birth. This is needed to comply with laws
designed to protect children. </p>

<p> We may also collect your eMail address. You can control whether
we send you only eMail messages required for the operation of the site,
or if we can also send you newsletters. </p>

<p> You can choose to provide your given name. We use this only to
address you in communications, and it is entirely voluntary. </p>

<p> You can choose a name for your Toot™ character in Tootsville™. If
you are a minor, your parents must approve your name. You must choose a

credit card or account number, billing address, and other information
required to transact your payment. We store your shipping information
only as needed to confirm delivery and provide customer service on your
sale. We do not store your financial credentials (like credit card
number). We may track the expiration date of your credit card if you
enter into a recurring payment or subscription, in order to remind you
if your credit card is about to expire. </p>

<h3> Information we collect from children </h3>

<p> We recommend children aged 13 to 17 get their parent's permission
before using Tootsville™. </p>

<p> Children under the age of 13 require parental content to use

child's date of birth and parent or guardian's eMail address. We do
not collect any other personal information from children. </p>

<p> Parents can review their child(ren)'s Tootsville™ accounts at any
time, and can choose to have these accounts deleted. This will revoke
parental consent as well. </p>
