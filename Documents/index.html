<h1> “Romance” Game System </h1>
<p> This is the development home of the “Romance” game system, based around
the Appius Claudius Cæcus game server and Publius Vergilius Maro game client
framework. </p>
<h2> What is here? </h2>
<p> Here, you can: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="src/latest/">Download</a> the Romance source code </li>
<li> With <a
href="mailto:brpocock+svnrequest@star-hope.org?subject=Subversion+Access+Requested+for+Romance">permission</a>,
access the Subversion repository to contribute to Romance </li>
<li> Read the current <a href="doc/">JavaDoc</a> documentation, and <a
href="Designer/">Designer</a> and <a href="Developer/">Developer</a>
documents, as well. </li>
</ul>
<h2> What does it do? </h2>
<p> Appius Claudius Cæcus is a Java-based videogame server. It handles
communications between players, enforcing game-specific rules, and managing
things like inventory and currency. </p>
<p> Appius supports access using a JSON-based protocol called Infinity. It
also supports a subset of the communications protocol of <a
href="http://www.gotoandplay.it/">Smart Fox Server Pro</a> for
compatibility, but the feature sets do not align (SFS has features which
Appius does not implement, and vice-versa) so there are still some client
changes necessary to integrate with Appius. Communications using Infinity
can be conducted in TCP stream-oriented fashion, in a TCP
batched-command-set mode, or using a WebSocket. </p>
<p> Publius Vergilius Maro is a Java-based client-side architecture for
communicating with Appius and playing a game (e.g. drawing a scene). It is
being developed currently for use with <a
href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> applications, and can also be
compiled into native binary applications for many platforms using GCC (GCJ),
into JavaScript (EcmaScript) using Google Web Toolkit (GWT), and is intended
to be potentially portable to Java Mobile Edition and other Java-based
application hosts. </p>
<h2> Who uses it? </h2>
