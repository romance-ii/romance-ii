Appius Claudius Caecus, Gaius Valerius Catullus, Publius Vergilius Maro,
and related classes provided in the org.starhope namespace are licensed
to the general public under the terms of the GNU Affero General  Public
License, either  Version 3 or (at  your option) any later version to be
published   by   the   Free   Software  Foundation.    See   the   file
"COPYING.Affero" for details.

 * SPECIAL EXEMPTION:

 If your videogame is committing changes back to the “master” version
 control repository (currently Star-Hope.org, and in the near future
 migrating to SourceForge.net), you are given a special exemption from
 the AGPL publication requirements, IF you meet the following
 conditions:

  > Your contributions must be checked in to either the trunk or a
    branch on the main version-control server, and therefore visible
    to all other contributors and users through that system;

   -AND-

  > Whenever you release a new version of code to your publicly-
    accessible beta or production game server(s), you must add a “tag”
    in the version control system of the form:

      (YOURGAMENAME)_(YEAR)_(MONTH)_(DAY).(OPTIONAL-NOTE)

    For example,

      /Romance/tags/Tootsville_2010_11_15.Production_release

   -AND-

  > The appropriate check-ins must be performed either prior to making
    your executable code accessible to the general public (e.g. beta
    or production servers), or within 24 hours.

  > IF you comply with ALL THREE of the above requirements, we will
    give you the following special exemption:

    1. You are not OBLIGATED to include the AGPL notification from
       within your game (as would otherwise be required by § 5.b & d
       of COPYING.Affero)

    2. You are not OBLIGATED to provide a local copy of the source
       code for download (as would otherwise be required by § 13 of
       COPYING.Affero)

This  license  does   not  apply  to  the  contents   of  the  package
com.tootsville  or  other packages.  See  the  individual packages  or
classes for their own licensing terms.

Most of this code is Copyright © 2008-2012, Bruce-Robert Pocock. Major
contributors include Tim Heys and Edward Winkelman.

Individual Java classes and other files may have their own copyright
notices, which supersede this one.

The com.tootsville package (which should be absent from most public
distributions of this code) is NOT licensed under the GNU GPL (with
few exceptions). The com.tootsville package contains proprietary code
created for Res Interactive, LLC., and licensed for their perpetual
use, with restrictive copyrights. (There are a couple of GPL files in
the Romance distribution in this package. They should/will be renamed
into the org.starhope namespace before Appius 1.2.)

CONTRIBUTING:

Contact me at brpocock@star-hope.org for commit privileges

BUILDING:

Currently we're just autobuilding in Eclipse. I haven't built a proper
Ant script yet.

Note that you must supply (at least) classes to implement User and
provide a RunCommands for your game to boot. See Empires_of_the_Air
project in Star-Hope Subversion for examples.

You'll also need the (heavily) edited version of WebSockets4J to
boot Caesar, also available in Star-Hope's Subversion.

 > Look under Documents/ for more documentation.

PLANS:

Contact me for discussion of directions as we move toward Appius 1.2

Note that we may be migrating to Sourceforge shortly.
